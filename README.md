# QuantumTransport++

🧠 A C++/Python hybrid toolkit for quantum transport, semiclassical dynamics, Berry curvature, Kubo and Boltzmann response in tight-binding models.

## Features

- 🧱 Multi-band tight-binding models in **k-space**
- ⚙️ Semiclassical **Boltzmann transport** with Berry curvature + Berry dipole
- 📶 Linear response via **Kubo conductivity**
- 🌀 Floquet fields (planned)
- 🐍 Python bindings via `pybind11`
- 📊 Notebook examples + plotting

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone ...
cd QuantumTransport++
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
